/**
 * A skeletal visitor for annotation values with default behavior
 * appropriate for the {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_7 RELEASE_7}
 * source version.
 *
 * <p> <b>WARNING:</b> The {@code AnnotationValueVisitor} interface
 * implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the
 * future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures
 * added to future versions of the Java&trade; programming language.
 * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code "visit"} may be
 * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
 * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
 * methods with names beginning with {@code "visit"}.
 *
 * <p>When such a new visit method is added, the default
 * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
 * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new abstract annotation
 * value visitor class will also be introduced to correspond to the
 * new language level; this visitor will have different default
 * behavior for the visit method in question.  When the new visitor is
 * introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
 *
 * <p>Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method
 * in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a <em>default
 * method</em> directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8
 * language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since
 * this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7
 * implementations.  Future versions of the API that are only required
 * to run on Java SE 8 and later may take advantage of default methods
 * in this situation.
 *
 * @param <R> the return type of this visitor's methods
 * @param <P> the type of the additional parameter to this visitor's methods.
 *
 * @see AbstractAnnotationValueVisitor6
 * @see AbstractAnnotationValueVisitor8
 * @since 1.7
